For native DSD support for XMOS based USB DACs (e.g. iFi nano/micro iDSD) see:

Native DSD support now in a working state. It requires support in the ALSA
driver (sample format SNDRV_PCM_FORMAT_DSD_U8).

Tested on BeagleBone Black with Botic linux driver.
See: http://www.diyaudio.com/forums/twisted-pear/258254-support-botic-linux-driver.html

How to enable native DSD playback support:

add the new 'dsd_native' config option to the audio_output section in the
mpd.conf file. E.g.

audio_output {
        type            "alsa"
        name            "Botic"
        device          "hw:0,0"
        dsd_native      "yes"

# BOTIC fixup: request the lowest period time
        period_time     "1"
}


For DoP (DSD-over-PCM) output, the 'dsd_usb' option is still available.
If both 'dsd_native' and 'dsd_usb' are configured the 'dsd_usb' option takes
precedence.

** Warning ** Do not enable dsd_native on systems which do not support it **
